<!--
Entry 48:
This is where we build our pre loaded data that will be injected to our local memory database using Hibernate

This data files are called Flat XML data files where we can create one file with entries as many tables as we like. We
put all the data into a root node of dataset, just like that.

For each ROW of data we would like to insert into our test database we create an XML element inside the dataset element,
whose tag name is the entity that we are inserting in this case role. Then inside the tag there will be ATTRIBUTES that
will represent the column name and the value that we want to insert into that specific column.

NOTE: in the user tag the role_id attribute is the cross column with the role tag (table) all user has role as user

NOTE: we assign different amount of Favorites (3 for user 1 and 2 for user 2) so we can test if the returned number of
favorites indeed refers to the correct user.

<dataset>
    <role id="1" name="ROLE_USER"/>


    <user id="1" username="user1" password="password" enabled="true" role_id="1"/>
    <user id="2" username="user2" password="password" enabled="true" role_id="1"/>

    <favorite id="1" user_id="1"/>
    <favorite id="2" user_id="1"/>
    <favorite id="3" user_id="1"/>
    <favorite id="4" user_id="2"/>
    <favorite id="5" user_id="2"/>

</dataset>
